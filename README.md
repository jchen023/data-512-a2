## Reflections and Implications

From the results of my analysis, I found that the top countries by article coverage and quality are very small countries and some of them unheard of prior to this assignment. This is largely caused by the fact that the extremes are more likely to appear when we have a smaller sample size (in this case, small population). It is also interesting to see that North America scores somewhere near average for both coverage and quality articles. It might make sense that it lags behind European countries, considering their longer history and multiple-party political system. However, the fact that it lag behind Carribean on per person adjusted basis is intriguing, considering that we are talking about the English Wikipedia pages.

Another interesting takeaway is that China politicians have the lowest number of quality article per population. Given that US and China are in a Thucydides Trap and news on China and Chinese politicians is seen on a daily basis, it is quite surprising to see if that not many Chinese politicians have good quality articles (only 40). I also wonder if we are only counting politicians from modern China and if emperors from various dynasties count as well.
